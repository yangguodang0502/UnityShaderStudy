Hi, thanks for buying.

You can use the material in different parts of your scene and it will look unique in each part. See the "Stylized_Brick_Wall" Scene in the "Demo Scene" folder.

In order to know how to use these materials deeply, watch the official video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvLsw1Cy4Lg

If you need a specific material you can ask me and i will do my best to make it. If you have any problems, doubts or sugestions, please, let me know.
